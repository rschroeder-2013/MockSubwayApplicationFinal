You have to select a store and enter a junk email in order to access the site. I have provided a PDF of the site to save you any hastle of going through the
initial setup.

Almost all text has been copy pasted from the above site, and all Subway words have been replaced with my fictional franchise Subwich, all information
referenced is the intellectual property of Subway and all text was used for the sake of authenticity.

The netbeans project in this folder contains a single HTML doc with the entire webpage as well as a PDF of the webpage used as inspiration.



Features that don't work
------------------------
I had a hard time validating all of my form inputs. I tried using the 'required' attribute along with the GET method in each of my form attributes. But
I was unable to have those empty fields validated. I also could'nt display any error messages as validation and errors go hand-in-hand, so that was another feature I
had issues implementing.
